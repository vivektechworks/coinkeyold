Here are the most common scams — and how to avoid them.

---

## 🚨 1. Fake Airdrops
Promises:
- “Claim 1000 USDT”
- “Free airdrop”
- “Connect wallet to receive tokens”

These websites try to drain your wallet.

**Tip:** Never connect your wallet to unknown websites.

---

## 🚨 2. Fake Customer Support
Scammers message you:
- “Hello sir, I am support team”
- “Verify your account”
- “Send your seed phrase for help”

**Real support will NEVER ask for seed phrase.**

---

## 🚨 3. Telegram & WhatsApp Scammers
Common messages:
- “Double your money”
- “Guaranteed profit”
- “Join this crypto mining scheme”

These are all scams.

---

## 🚨 4. Phishing Websites
Scammers create fake websites like:
- metamask-support.io  
- app-uniswap.net  
- coinbase-verify.org  

They look real but they steal your wallet.

**Always check the URL.**

---

## 🚨 5. Fake Trading Bots
Websites claiming:
- 100% accurate trades  
- Guaranteed daily profit  
- Risk-free trading  

These are Ponzi schemes.

---

## 🛡 How to Stay Safe
- Never share your **seed phrase**  
- Double-check all URLs  
- Do not trust random Telegram/Instagram messages  
- Avoid clicking on unknown links  
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts  
- Learn before investing

## 🎯 Summary
Crypto is safe — **people are not**.  
Scams exploit lack of knowledge, not blockchain weaknesses.  
Stay informed and take your time before trusting anything online.
