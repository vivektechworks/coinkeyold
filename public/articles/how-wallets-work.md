# How Crypto Wallets Work

A crypto wallet is a tool that lets you **store, send, and receive** cryptocurrency.

## 🔑 Types of Wallets
### 1. **Hot Wallets (Online)**
Examples:
- MetaMask  
- Trust Wallet  
- Phantom  

Pros: Easy, fast  
Cons: More vulnerable to hacks  

### 2. **Cold Wallets (Offline)**
Examples:
- Ledger  
- Trezor  

Pros: Safest  
Cons: Slightly harder for beginners  

## 🔐 The Most Important Concept: Seed Phrase
Your wallet gives you a **12 or 24 word seed phrase**, such as:

Anyone who has this phrase **owns your entire wallet**.

### Never Share It
- Not with support  
- Not with friends  
- Not with “airdrop” websites  
- Not with Telegram bots  

## 🏦 How a Wallet Works Internally
- The wallet generates a **private key** from your seed phrase.  
- All your “accounts” are derived from this private key.  
- Your crypto is NOT stored inside the wallet — it stays on the blockchain.  
- The wallet is just an **access key**.

## ✔ Summary
Your wallet = **your bank**.  
Your seed phrase = **your key to the bank vault**.  
Keep it safe.
